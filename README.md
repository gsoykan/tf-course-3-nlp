# NLP course 3 - Tensorflow

Learning Materials for NLP course of Tensorflow Pro. Developer Course

## Description

Week by week notebooks of the course. Notebooks do not include graded function implementations. That is your responsibility, but we will go over them anyways :)


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Create a new conda or virtual environment and install dependencies via pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

* This is a public repo, if you want to clone it do it so :)

### Executing program

* Most of the materials are .ipynb notebooks. However, some of the data might not be included in the repo, such as Glove embeddings. You should get them by yourself. A nice way can be to download them from Coursera.
